                            <p> This is the 3rd guide which will provide summary level hero level information. This is an attempt to combine both the updated talent list (https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleClash/comments/6jpmw8/discussion_updated_talent_priority_list/?st=j6pzk3yjampsh=7bc84a5c) and the enchantment priority list (https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleClash/comments/6sbpx3/enchantment_priority_list/?st=j6prwmlzampsh=5df9a373) as well as Trait recommendations to get a preferred setup for each Hero. I am using. 
So I am back from holidays and jetlagged, so I updated the lists since I can't sleep. ## Hero Priority List (https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleClash/comments/6vqv4m/hero_priority_list/) Added Dove, Cirrina, Storm, Ribbit and Lavanica Added Regen, BF, Feint and Iron Will Not all heroes were updated, only ones who's priority has changed or uses one of the new talents. Moved FG and VL up for a lot of heroes Moved WG and BW down for a lot of heroes, now that BF and IW are available. I've been playing Castle Clash for 4 years now and have had it with their "Value" packs! And items only accessible with few hundreds of $$$! I've spent Hundreds on the game and still am not able to keep up. Searching through google and youtube, I'm unable to find any similar games that is NOT P2W. I dont mind the grind, and love leveling up my heroes, and dont mind paying one-off for a game. But just not constantly paying to be on top. Would really appreciate if anyone can help recommen. So, not fake news after all? March 11th: It was obvious that CC2 was coming, we just don't know how it will be as I mentioned several times. Can be upgrade, they can move our data like they did at Clash of Lords 2, or it may be a separate game. Who knows? Update: IGG says it will be separate. Another round of updates for these. ## Hero Priority List (https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleClash/comments/6vqv4m/hero_priority_list/) Added Asura, Rascals, Ma Hatma, Boogeyman Added Sacred Light, Unholy Pact, Zealous Drive, Vital boon, Sunder and Survival Removed a bunch of old heroes nobody uses anymore to save space. Revised most (if not all) heroes. Special thanks to /u/Hanyabull who helped me do the largest review of this list. Moved SL and ZD up on a lot of heroes. Mostly after AC: III and/or Revelations for a combination of the games listed above. Also open to offers.
