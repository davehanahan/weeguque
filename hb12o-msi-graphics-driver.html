                            <p> Hello , i have got an issue with updating my graphic drivers on my msi PS42 modern with 1050 maxQ chip. There are not any drivers for this chip on the nvidia site , and the drivers that are aviable on the msi website are outdated  I just cant play new released games because it allways crashes because of the old driver  Is they any way i can get a new updated one ? Its so flustrating :( sorry for my bad english spelling skills. We're consolidating all tech support posts and questions into this weekly tech support and questions megathread.

I am switching from ryzen 5 1600 to ryzen 7 3700X once its released. and from GTX 1060 6GB to RTX 2060 6GB. I have the MSI B350 Tomahawk as my motherboard. I have 2 8GB Ram sticks and they are not that fast only 2400Mhz. My PSU is Masterwatt lite 600. I hope I don't have any compatibility issues. I believe that the first thing I have to do is to uninstall my graphics drivers and update my bios.then I swap my parts and boot into windows? Then I download my graphics drivers and I'm done? 
UserBenchmark says my gpu is performing way below expectations! GPU is MSI RTX 2060 Gaming Z I tried contacting MSI but they replied telling me to provide picture of actual gpu and etc, which i found not helpful and hassle as if they're not willing to help me! Did any of you guys here had similar problem before? image (https://imgur.com/a/BZ6Xa7Z). Figured I would post this in case anyone else notices a similar issue. I originally installed the Intel graphics drivers (version 24.20.100.6169) from MSI's website a few days ago. I ended up doing a clean re-install of those same drivers trying to solve some minor bugs. However, after the re-install, Intel graphics control panel would not open at all. I ended up clean installing new drivers from Intel's own website (version 24.20.100.6286) and the control panel works properly. Hey, I really hope someone here can help me. I've been really frustrated lately while trying to play multiple games on Steam and uPlay. The list is below. What will happen is, during gameplay, it will suddenly freeze for 1 or 2 seconds, and then a generic error will come up: https://puu.sh/w0bPH/e57a6f83c2.jpg During my most recent example, while playing Dead Rising 3, I noticed flickering and graphical issues while playing. Sometimes the screen flashed white like a lightning I recently installed a fresh copy of windows 10 and I can’t find any of my driver discs, which used to be fine because I remembered the driver details for certain things, but I can’t remember the driver I need for my graphics card, however I don’t think that’s the only problem because I think windows 10 is maybe not compatible with my AMD card. I’m not sure what’s happening but any help is appreciated. Total budget and country of purchase: 00ish/USA Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I currently have a 2 in 1 and it was definitely not worth the extra money when I bought it. Decent battery life, good build quality, compact form factor and longevity are probably my main concerns. How important is weight and thinness to you? As long as it fits in my backpack and I could.

I went to fire up some games this evening and noticed my FPS counter wasn't displaying in the bottom left corner and that my games like WWE 2K19 and Just Cause 4 are unplayable. I tried opening the NVidia Control panel and just get a message saying "Nvidia Display Settings not available. You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU." amp#x200B. Hey. I've spent a little while googling this and. i'm not even sure if i'm heading in the right direction. We have a game with a nice looking msi installer which is installing a unity game on someones computer. we've hit some issues on low-end machines where if the graphics card driver is older (pre-2015) the game will occasionally bug out HandleD3DDeviceLost and create a pretty shit user experience for the player. the game will flip them back to the desktop for a few seconds. 
Hi everyone, amp#x200B; I recently bought and installed an AMD Vega 64, upgrading from a GTX 970. I used DDU to swap the drivers, and since then, my headset microphone has a mediocre quality (Steelseries Siberia). amp#x200B; The only thing I did is to remove nvidia drivers and install latest AMD. Do you know if the drivers can affect microphones ? And if yes, do you have an idea about how to correct the issue. Hey i am using MSI Afterburner to check my GPU temperature etc. i haven't overclocked the or anything. When i turn on my PC the MHz jumps around then after 10 seconds it gets stuck at 139MHz. I was looking for a solution but i can't find it. In all my games now i am gaining 18 fps (CSGO), 7-10fps (BF5). Here is some pictures of my MSI Afterburner: https://imgur.com/a/ZHvtY12 (https://imgur.com/a/ZHvtY12) amp#x200B; My Spec: GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600. Im planning on building my first ever gaming pc and i need some help. I've been researching on all the parts and i have everything I need in Samsung Notes like drivers, what to install, and settings to change. But i do need help on the necessary motherboard drivers that I need. Here are the specs: Motherboard: MSI B450M PRO-VDH CPU: AMD RYZEN 3 2200G WITH STOCK COOLER GPU: EVGA GTX 1060 3GB RAM: G.Skill RipJaws V 8GB DDR4-2666 PC4-21300 CL15 SIN POWERSUPPLY: EVGA 500W POWERSUPPLY Hey. I have an MSI GS65 and updating my Intel Graphics Driver to x.x.x.6194 seems to break MSI True Color 2.1.2.0; changing modes doesn't work, and it's stuck in sRGB (which I set beforehand knowing it will break it). Is there any other way I can fix or is there a workaround with this without rolling back to the system restore point I made before updating it? Does MSI have to update the program for it to work with the latest drivers or is it SOL? Would be nice to make this work. I recently upgraded my computer to a Ryzen 5 2600, but my performance has dropped significantly. I’ve installed the newest drivers for everything, and I have no idea what’s going on. My frame rate has gotten significantly worse, being at less than half of what it was on some games despite a significant upgrade to my computer. I have no idea what to do at this point, and I just hope my Christmas present wasn’t in vain. Edit: Probably should have done this in the first place, but here: I am exchanging my GS65 for another one as mine has a defect. I would like to know the best way to create a mirror image as I know there are MSI drivers etc and do not want to lose them or create any problems. Thanks. Hi. After installing the latest ATI5850 windows 8 x64 drivers the following issues arose: chrome can't connect to the internet at all (other browsers are fine) windows picture viewer doesn't work at all vlc can't play any video files without crashing can't browse youtube as flash player crashes every time on multiple browsers All went away immediately after uninstalling the drivers completely. What a frustrating day! I can't believe how such random errors were caused by a GPU driver 
I recently bought a new graphics card for my computer, and i got it installed perfectly fine. However, when I went to install the drivers that came with the GPU, the installer didn't recognize my GPU, saying "A Nvidia graphics card is needed to use GeForce Experience. I am using the default integrated graphics in order to use the installer. I am 100% sure I meet the minimum system requirements, so that's not the issue. Another odd detail: when I plug in the graphics card to my monitor Welcome to MSI Service and Support. Customized services especially We review the new MSI GeForce GTX 1660 VENTUS XS 6G OC edition. The new product is more value targeted and sits in NVIDIA's new mainstream line of the GTX 1660 series. </p>
