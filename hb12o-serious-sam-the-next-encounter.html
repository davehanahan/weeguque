I was curious about what the least played GameCube games were and I figured I'd get a good enough idea by using the widely-used website GameFAQs, which lists GameCube games along with votes submitted by users for rating purposes.

Voyager in and of itself ended up being a pretty good show, but in a lot of ways it feels like a missed opportunity. With hindsight it's easy to see what Voyager could have done differently. Star Trek Voyager starts off with a great premise that the writers ultimately either didn't or couldn't take advantage of. Possibly because of limitations put in by the studio and the producers. Having been released in the pre-streaming pre-Battlestar Galactica era, the show is restricted by the TV trope.

But the final conversation between Dany and Jon at the end of the last episode leaves the biggest question on GOT unresolved: who has the right to hold the Iron Throne?

Основная статья: Serious Sam: Next Encounter. Игра для консолей GameCube и PlayStation 2 с новым сюжетом. Hello all, amp#x200B; I've had a list of unclaimed Steam keys in my Humble account for a while, and I figured I'd spread the love a little. Most of these games are not great, but there are some very good ones here and there that I already had. So I don't know how these usually go (first time poster in this subreddit), but rules say I have to wait 12h before starting to choose winners. I have honestly no clue how to decide on who gets a game if many users request the same one. Any ideas?.

There is a house near New Orleans, and before you make any jokes; no it isn't called the Rising Sun. It does have a rather memorable reputation though, and a name that will probably make you think twice about visiting. They call it the Killing House, and it only opens once a year on Halloween night. The premise of the Killing House is simple, you go in and while spending the night any type of crime you commit is off the record, total anonymity ala The Purge  As you might have guessed.

The series started on Microsoft Windows and has been released on a number of different platforms, including the Xbox, Xbox 360, Palm OS, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. Sam was a devoted, highly-intelligent, tireless companion. We covered, daily, between four and eight miles in our perambulations around the neighborhood. He checked-in on familiar street corners, leaf piles, and garbage bins. Sometimes we stopped for a quick greet and play bow with a friend. Other times he instinctively drew to my far side, acknowledging my role in our joint security, letting me face the unknown dog, person, or conveyance.

It took less than a week for LeBron James to start lowering expectations. Three games in, the Lakers remained winless after James missed a pair of free throws in the final seconds of an overtime loss to San Antonio.
